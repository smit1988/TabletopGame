# TabletopGame
Version 1 Description:
One table sized screen with an uploadable central board. The board can be moved as desired during setup but then locked in place. All players have a physically hidden game area (behind a divider in real life). There is a transition area within that divider to "Send to table". Infinite pools of things like resource cards or tokens. Decks of varied cards can also be uploaded as images. These decks can be shuffled.

Version 2:
Quality of life features discovered in version 1. I suspect it'll be things like deck searching and ordering, distrubuting a certain number of cards or pieces to specific players, snapping to grid, saving games, etc.

Version 3:
Multiplayer. Game area replaced by users' phones. This is likely mandatory due to 10 touch input limit on a single touch screen.
