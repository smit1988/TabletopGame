# TabletopGame
Version 1 Description:
One table sized screen with an uploadable central board. The board can be moved as desired during setup but then locked in place. All players have a physically hidden game area (behind a divider in real life). There is a transition area within that divider to "Send to table". Infinite pools of things like resource cards or tokens. Decks of varied cards can also be uploaded as images. These decks can be shuffled.

Version 2:
Quality of life features discovered in version 1. I suspect it'll be things like deck searching and ordering, distrubuting a certain number of cards or pieces to specific players, snapping to grid, saving games, etc.

Version 3:
Multiplayer. Game area replaced by users' phones. This is likely mandatory due to 10 touch input limit on a single touch screen.

TODO:
Add highlight and menu to board
-Resize, rotate, lock, duplicate
Lock game board in place. Something with layers for the user. User set game board layer & deck layer. 
Lock angle of options to angle of object (upsidedown for player 2). Though don't want it upside down if they uploaded it upside down...May actually lock it to which side of the board the menu was opened on
Doubletap option to enlarge card
Segment out menu a little more. Section off one time setup stuff to submenu.
Give everyone their own deck/board upload buttons
Option to remove new deck/board buttons
Undo?
Save game
Delete objects

bugs:
Fix 1308 frame being default card back. Need to make it unique to the deck in case cardback changes.
