# TabletopGame
Version 1 Description:
One table sized screen with an uploadable central board. The board can be moved as desired during setup but then locked in place. All players have a physically hidden game area (behind a divider in real life). There is a transition area within that divider to "Send to table". Infinite pools of things like resource cards or tokens. Decks of varied cards can also be uploaded as images. These decks can be shuffled.

Version 2:
Quality of life features discovered in version 1. I suspect it'll be things like deck searching and ordering, distrubuting a certain number of cards or pieces to specific players, snapping to grid, saving games, etc.

Version 3:
Multiplayer. Game area replaced by users' phones. This is likely mandatory due to 10 touch input limit on a single touch screen.

TODO:
Lock game board in place. Something with layers for the user. User set game board layer & deck layer. 
Option to make multiple unique decks (look into containers)
User set where a deck deals to
User set whether a card is dealt up or down
User set what tapping a card does (flip, rotate 90 degrees each time, swap between 90 degrees and 0 degrees only)
Add multiple of same image to deck. E.g. user uploads 5 images for a 20 card deck with 4 of each card.
Add card to top or bottom of deck
Resize deck
Custom card back
Set original deck size (at least ratio) based on the back of card uploaded
Infinite resource deck
Highlight the object being manipulated (i.e. what object the menu applies to)
