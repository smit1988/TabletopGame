# TabletopGameVersion 2:
Quality of life features discovered in version 1. I suspect it'll be things like deck searching and ordering, distrubuting a certain number of cards or pieces to specific players, snapping to grid, saving games, etc.

Version 3:
Multiplayer. Game area replaced by users' phones. This is likely mandatory due to 10 touch input limit on a single touch screen.

TODO:
Deleting object closes menu
Lock angle of options to angle of object (upsidedown for player 2). Though don't want it upside down if they uploaded it upside down...May actually lock it to which side of the board the menu was opened on
Doubletap option to enlarge card
Segment out menu a little more. Section off one time setup stuff to submenu.
Give everyone their own deck/board upload buttons
Undo?
Save game
Hidden divider (send to table button)
Deck show all button should not go off screen

bugs:
Fix 1308 frame being default card back. Need to make it unique to the deck in case cardback changes.
Loading a second card back overrides the first
