# TabletopGame
Version 1 Description:
One table sized screen with an uploadable central board. The board can be moved as desired during setup but then locked in place. All players have a physically hidden game area (behind a divider in real life). There is a transition area within that divider to "Send to table". Infinite pools of things like resource cards or tokens. Decks of varied cards can also be uploaded as images. These decks can be shuffled.

Version 2:
Quality of life features discovered in version 1. I suspect it'll be things like deck searching and ordering, distrubuting a certain number of cards or pieces to specific players, snapping to grid, saving games, etc.

Version 3:
Multiplayer. Game area replaced by users' phones. This is likely mandatory due to 10 touch input limit on a single touch screen.

TODO:
Lock game board in place. Something with layers for the user. User set game board layer & deck layer. 
Make Duplicate button immediately spawn a new card. Need to functionize DeckSprite generation. In 2 places currently.
Custom card back (I think this will have to be done after making a full deck editor. Click the picture of the card back and set the animation to that)
Lock angle of options to angle of object (upsidedown for player 2)
Add card to top or bottom of deck
Resize deck
Set original deck size (at least ratio) based on the back of card uploaded
